# Known Players

random known players (from a list) appear in the main menu insetad of random generated ones!

You can add your own players in a file called `players.json` in the `%gd path%\geode\config\iandyhd3.known_players` path

The json file the mod uses is [here](https://github.com/iAndyHD3/KnownPlayers/blob/master/assets/known_players.json) and its the same format that your `players.json` should use

There is also a [schema](https://github.com/iAndyHD3/KnownPlayers/blob/master/assets/schema.json) that you can use for code editors or validators

The mod supports other game modes (that are also randomized) but only actual recognizable game modes are added per player which makes it very rare to see ufos, waves, spiders etc. Ship is the most common game mode other than cube.
