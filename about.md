# Known Players

random known players (from a list) appear in the main menu insetad of random generated ones!

You can add your own cubes in a file called `players.json` in the `%gd path%\geode\config\iandyhd3.known_players` path

The main json file the mod uses is [here](https://github.com/iAndyHD3/KnownPlayers/blob/master/assets/known_players.json)

There is also a [schema](https://github.com/iAndyHD3/KnownPlayers/blob/master/assets/schema.json) that you can use for code editors or validators
